    Hi, my name is Amy. I've recently graduated from UC Irvine with a bachelor’s in Computer Science, specializing in Intelligent Systems. That’s where I first got introduced to data analytics in an Intro to Data Management course, and it really sparked my interest in how data can drive insights and decision-making. Right now, I am furthering my interest through the Data Analytics track at COOP, where I’m developing hands-on skills. Alongside that, I work as an Independent SQL Report Developer under the mentorship of a supervisor at Kaiser Permanente, which has given me real-world experience building reports and supporting healthcare data needs. Looking ahead, I want to join a company where I can continue growing as a data professional, learning from others while taking on challenges that push me to think critically. I’m especially excited about the potential of combining AI with analytics to uncover predictive trends and deliver even stronger insights into business decisions.
