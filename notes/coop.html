<h3>3Ws | Personal Pitch</h3>
<p> 
    1. Where I've Been.<br>
    2. Where I am.<br>
    3. Where I'm going.<br><br>
    Hi, My name is Amy. I've recently graduated from UC Irvine with a bachelor’s in computer science, where I specialized in Intelligent Systems. That was where I first got introduced to data analytics in an Intro to Data Management course, and it really sparked my interest in how data can drive insights and decision-making. Right now, I am furthering my interest through the Data Analytics track at COOP, where I’m developing hands-on skills. Alongside that, I work as an Independent SQL Report Developer under the mentorship of a supervisor at Kaiser Permanente, which has given me real-world experience building reports and supporting healthcare data needs. Looking ahead, I want to join a company where I can continue growing as a data professional, learning from others while taking on challenges that push me to think critically. I’m especially excited about the potential of combining AI with analytics to uncover predictive trends and deliver even strong insights into business decisions.

<h3>Data Visualization Project & EDA process</h3>
<p>
    Apply Knowledge of Excel and Tableau to complete a real-world data visualization project in teams using the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) framework.<br>
    EDA is the process of examining and summarizing a dataset to better understand its main characteristics, patterns, and relationships between variables. It helps identify potential problems, errors, or interesting trends in the data before diving into more advanced analysis. The steps are:<br>
    1. Ask questions.<br>
    2. Collect and import data.<br>
    3. Clean data.<br>
    4. Explore data.<br>
    5. Visualize data.<br>
    6. Analyze and interpret.<br>
    7. Share findings.<br>
