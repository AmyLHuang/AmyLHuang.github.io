        <h4><u>Automatidata</u></h4>
        <p><strong>Project goal:</strong> In this fictional scenario, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission
            (TLC) has approached the data consulting firm Automatidata to develop an app that enables TLC riders to
            estimate taxi fares in advance of their ride.</p>

        <p><strong>Background:</strong> Since 1971, TLC has been regulating and overseeing the licensing of New York
            City's taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles.</p>

        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The recently submitted New York City TLC project proposal has been approved. The
            Automatidata team now has access to the TLC data to analyze, identify key variables, and prepare for
            exploratory data analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Course 2 tasks:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Load, explore, and extract the TLC data with Python</li>
            <li>Use custom functions to organize the dataset</li>
            <li>Build a dataframe for the TLC project</li>
            <li>Create an executive summary for Automatidata</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><u>TikTok</u></h4>
        <p><strong>Project goal:</strong> The TikTok data team is developing a machine learning model for classifying
            claims made in videos.</p>

        <p><strong>Background:</strong> TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. Its mission is to
            create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic content.</p>

        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> As a data analyst on TikTok's data team, you’ll prepare the claims dataset,
            organize it for exploratory data analysis, and share progress insights.</p>

        <p><strong>Course 2 tasks:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Build a dataframe for the TikTok dataset</li>
            <li>Read data from a CSV file</li>
            <li>Display rows and examine data types</li>
            <li>Gather descriptive statistics</li>
            <li>Visualize the data in Python</li>
            <li>Report to TikTok’s data team through an executive summary</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><u>Waze</u></h4>
        <p><strong>Project goal:</strong> Waze leadership asked the data team to develop a machine learning model to
            predict monthly user churn. An accurate model helps prevent churn, improve retention, and grow Waze’s
            business.</p>

        <p><strong>Background:</strong> Waze’s free navigation app is supported by a community of editors, testers,
            translators, partners, and users.</p>

        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The churn project has been approved and the team has access to user data. Before
            analysis, the data must be inspected, organized, and prepared.</p>

        <p><strong>Course 2 tasks:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Import user data</li>
            <li>Create and inspect a dataframe</li>
            <li>Identify outliers</li>
            <li>Create data visualizations</li>
            <li>Share an executive summary with the Waze data team</li>
        </ul>
