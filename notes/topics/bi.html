<h2>Business Intelligence</h2>
<p>Business Intelligence (BI) refers to the systematic use of data in an organization. It encompasses the tools, technologies, and practices used to collect, integrate, analyze, and present business data for critical business operations. By leveraging BI, organizations can uncover insights, patterns, and trends, allowing them to make informed and strategic business decisions (aka data driven decision making).</p>

<h3>Tableau</h3>
<p>Tableau is an interactive visualization software tool owned by Salesforce, that allows users to explore and understand their data to influence business decisions. Tableau Desktop is a paid product but <strong>Tableau Public</strong> is free. All reports in Tableau Public are public once they're published.</p>
<p>A <strong>discrete variable</strong> consists of finite or countable values that cannot be broken down into smaller units. On Tableau, they are <strong>blue pills/fields</strong> and produce headers. A <strong>continuous variable</strong> consists on infinite values or values within a certain range. These values are often measured using decimal points. In Tableau, they are the <strong>green pills/fields</strong> and produce an axis. </p>
<p>A <strong>dimension</strong> is a qualitative or categorical data. Usually, they are listed on the x-axis of a chart. A <strong>measure</strong> is a quantitative or numerical data that can be aggregated (sum, average, etc.). Usually they are listed on the y-axis of a chart.</p>

<h3>Visualizations</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bar charts</strong>: represent data in rectangular bars, where the height of the bar corresponds to the value of the data being displayed</li>
    <li><strong>Heat maps</strong>: represent data in a table/spreadsheet format, where the cells usually have a gradient or diverging color palette overlaying the values</li>
    <li><strong>Line charts</strong>: consists of data connected by stright lines to show how a variable changes</li>
    <li><strong>Scatterplots</strong>: used to display the relationship or correlation between two quantitative variables</li>
    <li><strong>Histograms</strong>: used to represent distributions in frequency based on different ranges</li>
