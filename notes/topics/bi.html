<h2>Business Intelligence</h2>
<p>Business Intelligence (BI) refers to the systematic use of data in an organization. It encompasses the tools, technologies, and practices used to collect, integrate, analyze, and present business data for critical business operations. By leveraging BI, organizations can uncover insights, patterns, and trends, allowing them to make informed and strategic business decisions (aka data driven decision making). A BI tool usually performs tasks such as data connection, data mining, data transformation, data modeling, complex calculations, report building, dashboard creation, online analytical processing, and predictive analysis.</p>
<p>A data warehouse consists of a huge storage of data gathered from sources to aid the process of making an informed decision at any level of an enterprise. A typical data warehouse follows an ETL process: extract data from sources, transform the data to meet requirements, and load transformed data into targeted tables. A BI tool takes data from a data warehouse.</p>

<h3>Visualizations</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bar charts</strong>: represent data in rectangular bars, where the height of the bar corresponds to the
        value of the data being displayed</li>
    <li><strong>Heat maps</strong>: represent data in a table/spreadsheet format, where the cells usually have a
        gradient or diverging color palette overlaying the values</li>
    <li><strong>Line charts</strong>: consists of data connected by stright lines to show how a variable changes</li>
    <li><strong>Scatterplots</strong>: used to display the relationship or correlation between two quantitative
        variables</li>
    <li><strong>Histograms</strong>: used to represent distributions in frequency based on different ranges</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tableau</h3>
<p>Tableau is an interactive visualization software tool owned by Salesforce, that allows users to explore and understand their data to influence business decisions. Tableau Desktop is a paid product but <strong>Tableau Public</strong> is free. All reports in Tableau Public are public once they're published.</p>
<p>A <strong>discrete variable</strong> consists of finite or countable values that cannot be broken down into smaller units. On Tableau, they are <strong>blue pills/fields</strong> and produce headers. A <strong>continuous variable</strong> consists on infinite values or values within a certain range. These values are often measured using decimal points. In Tableau, they are the <strong>green pills/fields</strong> and produce an axis. </p>
<p>A <strong>dimension</strong> is a qualitative or categorical data. Usually, they are listed on the x-axis of a chart. A <strong>measure</strong> is a quantitative or numerical data that can be aggregated (sum, average, etc.). Usually they are listed on the y-axis of a chart.</p>

<h3>Power BI</h3>
<p><strong>Prepare the data → Model the data → Visualize and analyze the data → Manage and secure Power BI</strong></p>
<u>Power Query</u>
<p>Power Query acts as an “ETL” tool for Power BI. It also facilitates an “Applied Steps” feature, which records every step done in the Power Query. This way, when new data is added, all the steps get applied to it automatically when the model is refreshed.</p>
<u>Data Modeling</u>
<p>One of Power BI's strengths is that data does not need to be flattened into a single table. Instead, multiple tables from various sources can be used while defining relationships between them. To create a relationship, drag the field from one table and drop it on the field of the other table that you want to link. Relationships can also be managed using the “Manage Relationship” option under the Home tab.</p>

<u>DAX</u>
<p>Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a collection of functions, operators, and constants used to calculate and return one or more values. It helps create new information from existing data present in the model. DAX is used when creating a “calculate table,” a “calculated column,” or a “measure.”</p>
<p>In Power BI, measures are defined as calculations on your data that are performed at the time of your query. Measures are calculated as you interact with your reports and aren't stored in your database.</p>

<u>Row-Level Security</u>
<p>Row-Level Security (RLS) is a feature that restricts data access for different users based on their roles. It ensures that users only see the data they are authorized to view.</p>
<u>Dashboard</u>
<p>Dashboard is a feature of Power BI Service. This is not available in Power BI Desktop. A pro license is needed. Unlike a report, filtering and slicing are not available for dashboards.</p>
