            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Stock Trading Bot is a Python-based application that uses historical stock market data to predict future stock price movements, specifically focusing on companies within the S&P 500. The bot is capable of suggesting potential trades based on predicted price trends.</p>

        <section class="problem">
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Accurately predicting stock prices is a complex challenge due to market volatility, noise, and unpredictable external factors. Many beginner trading tools oversimplify the analysis, leading to poor trading decisions based on incomplete data.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="goal">
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>By utilizing historical stock data and applying predictive algorithms, the Stock Trading Bot aims to provide users with better-informed trading suggestions. It uses statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to detect patterns and make probabilistic forecasts about future price trends.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="results">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Based on our findings, using temporal ensembles could potentially boost the trading bot's performance in certain situations. However, the agents don't consistently produce positive returns. There is possibility of negative returns and underperformance (which may be caused by the hyperparameters, the market conditions, and even the model itself) even though there were previous instances of positive returns.</p>
